Version 0.2
-----------
(Not yet released)

- We have documentation!
- Fields now have a `required` argument which if set to False allows fields to
  accept either a fully validated value, or no value at all. Defaults to True.
- Changed the way fields take parameters, they are no longer quasi magic. This
  is a breaking change. Please see the documentation for the new syntax.
- Added optional description argument to Field, acessible on the field as
  `description`. This provides an easy way to define e.g. help text in the same
  place as the form.
- Added a regexp validator.
- Renamed wtforms.contrib to wtforms.ext and reorganised wtforms.ext.django.
  This is a breaking change if you were using the django extensions, but should
  only require changing your imports around a little.

Version 0.1
