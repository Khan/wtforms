Fields
======

.. module:: wtforms.fields

Fields are responsible for rendering and data conversion. They delegate to
validators for data validation.

Field definitions
-----------------

.. autoclass:: Field
    :members: __call__, _validate, process_data, process_formdata 


    **Properties**

    .. attribute:: name

        The HTML form name of this field. This is the name as defined in your 
        Form prefixed with the `prefix` passed to the Form constructor.

    .. attribute:: id

        The HTML ID of this field. By default, this is auto-generated by
        appending the field's name to :attr:`~wtforms.form.Form._idprefix`

    .. attribute:: label

        This is a :class:`Label` instance which when evaluated as a string 
        returns an html ``<label for="id">`` construct.

    .. attribute:: description
        
        A string containing the value of the description passed in the
        constructor to the field; this is not HTML escaped.

    .. attribute:: type

        The type of this field, as a string. This can be used in your templates
        to do logic based on the type of field:

        .. code-block:: django

            {% for field in form %}
                <tr>
                {% if field.type == "BooleanField" %}
                    <td></td>
                    <td>{{ field }} {{ field.label }}</td>
                {% else %}
                    <td>{{ field.label }}</td>
                    <td>{{ field }}</td>
                {% end %}
                </tr>
            {% endfor %}

    .. attribute:: data

        Data for this field, already coerced to the python type stored by the
        field.  Not HTML escaped.

    .. attribute:: errors
        
        A list of strings with the errors for this field only.
