Crash Course
============

This Crash Course will provide a brief overview of how one would go about creating their first forms in WTForms. It will expose key features of the framework through mainly code examples. For in-depth description of the modules, you'll want to read the :ref:`api` documentation.

Getting Started
---------------

If you have not installed WTForms yet, the :ref:`introduction <installation>`
will get you started.  Once you've done that, you can begin writing your first
Form::

    from wtforms import Form, BooleanField, TextField, PasswordField, validators

    class RegistrationForm(Form):
        username     = TextField('Username', [validators.length(min=4, max=25)])
        email        = TextField('Email Address', [validators.length(min=6, max=35)])
        accept_rules = BooleanField('I accept the site rules')

When you create a form, you define the fields in a way which is very similar
to the way many ORM's have you define their columns, by defining class
variables which are instantiations of the fields. 

Since a form is a regular python class, they can even be extended as needed::

    from wtforms import Form, DateTimeField, TextField, TextAreaField, validators

    class ProfileForm(Form):
        birthday  = DateTimeField('Your Birthday', format='%m/%d/%y')
        signature = TextAreaField('Forum Signature')

    class AdminProfileForm(ProfileForm):
        title  = TextField('User Title', [validators.length(max=40)])

In the above, AdminProfileForm would inherit all the fields of the
ProfileForm, thus having 3 fields.  While showing additional fields could also
be performed at the template level, validation would be performed even on
fields the user couldn't see. Because of this, it's often better to define
separate forms which inherit each other. 


Using forms in a view
---------------------

Using a form in a view is as simple as instantiating it::

    def register(request):
        form = RegistrationForm(request.POST, prefix='register')
        if request.POST and form.validate():
            # create new user and show the confirmation page
            pass
        return render_to_response('account/register', {'form': form})
    
The form can be given a prefix, which will be prepended to the form variable
names. By using different prefixes, one can use multiple forms on the same
page, as well. You then pass your form to your template so you can use it for
rendering the fields to HTML.


Rendering your form in templates
--------------------------------

Rendering your fields in a template involves simply accessing the field on the
form object.  The label and description are available as properties on the
field as well.

.. code-block:: jinja

    <form method="post" action="/register">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>{{ form.username.label }}</th>
        <td>{{ form.username }}</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>{{ form.email.label }}</th>
        <td>{{ form.email }}</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>{{ form.accept_rules }} {{ form.accept_rules.label }}</td>
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="Register!" />
    </form>

If you inspect the above carefully, you will notice a few things.  While
WTForms will generate input fields, it will not generate the <form> tags.  It
can be made to generate submit buttons if you feel the need to check for submit
button inputs (more about that in the future) but you're not forced to.
Rendering the label will generate the appropriate ``<label for="id">``
enclosure for the field as well.

Field customization in Jinja templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to add customization to your form fields (such as CSS 
classes, onclick events, etc) you can do so by passing keyword 
arguments to the form fields as such:

.. code-block:: jinja

  {{ form.username(class="big_text", onclick="do_something()") }}


Field customization in Django templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding :mod:`wtforms.ext.django` to your INSTALLED_APPS will make the wtforms 
template library available to your application.  With this you can pass extra 
attributes to form fields similar to the usage in jinja:

.. code-block:: django

  {% load wtforms %}

  {% form_field form.username class="big_text" onclick="do_something()" %}


**Note:** By default in Django, output from WTForms using the 
``{{form.field}}`` syntax will be auto-escaped.  To avoid this happening, 
use Django's ``{% autoescape off %}`` block tag or use 
WTForms' `form_field` template tag.


Adding custom validation
------------------------

In previous examples, you can see we used some of the built-in validators from
the :mod:`wtforms.validators` module. You can also define your own validators
like so::

    from wtforms.validators import ValidationError
    import re

    def validate_telephone(form, field):
        if not re.match(r'([0-9]{3,4}-?)+', field.data):
            raise ValidationError(u'This does not look like a valid telephone number to me. Try dash-separated triads.')


A validator is just a python callable which takes two arguments. It could 
just as easily be a class or a function closure if you want.

Since one-time use validators are likely to be used often, we have 
developed a way to write them inline::

    class RegistrationForm(Form):
        username         = TextField('Username', validators.length(min=4, max=25))
        
        def _validate_username(form, field):
            if not re.match(r'[a-z][A-Z0-9_-]+', field.data, re.I):
                raise ValidationError(u'Usernames must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and - _')



Using select fields
-------------------

Select fields keep a `choices` property which is a sequence of `(value,
label)` pairs.  The value portion can be any type in theory, but as form data
is sent by the browser as strings, you will need to provide a function which
can coerce the string representation back to a comparable object.  More about
this later.


Select fields with static choice values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    class PastebinEntry(Form):
        language = SelectField(u'Programming Language', choices=[('cpp', 'C++'), ('py', 'Python'), ('text', 'Plain Text')])

Note that the `choices` keyword is only evaluated once, so if you want to make
a dynamic drop-down list that could be different for each instance of the
form, you'll want to look at the next section.


Select fields with dynamic choice values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    class UserDetails(Form):
        group_id = SelectField(u'Group', checker=int)
        username = TextField

    def edit_user(request, id):
        user = User.query.get(id)
        form = UserDetails(request.POST, obj=user)
        form.group_id.choices = [(g.id, g.name) for g in Group.query.order_by('name')]

        if request.POST and form.validate():
            # Copy all the form values onto the user object
            form.auto_populate(user) 
            db.session.flush([user])

        return render_to_response('edit_user.html', {'form': form})

Note we didn't pass a `choices` to the :class:`~wtforms.fields.SelectField` 
constructor, but rather created the list in the view function. Also, the 
`checker` keyword arg to :class:`~wtforms.fields.SelectField` says that we 
use :func:`int()` to coerce form data.  The default checker is 
:func:`unicode()`. 

This code example also highlights another feature of wtforms: having a form's
default values be that of a model object, and then copying the fields back to
the model object on save  (Unlike other forms frameworks, WTForms will not
directly modify your db model object, it is up to you when and if you want
this to happen.)
